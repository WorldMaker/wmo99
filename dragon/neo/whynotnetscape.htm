<h1>Why Not Netscape?</h1>
<small>Or, Why this page isn't tested with Netscape.</small>

<P>Let me start off with my apologies to Netscape users.  I'm sorry
that I can not be sure that my page is acceptable on both systems.</P>

<h2>The Trouble with Netscape</h2>

<P>First of all, I do not hate Netscape.  In fact, I think Netscape
hates me.  Every time I have ever used/tried Netscape, within days,
the browser would be permanently locked up and would not work at
all.</P>

<P>Second, I may be a geek/nerd/whatever, but I do not share the
"Anti-Microsoft" spirit.  I like Microsoft, their products are always
well written, their programs are reliable, even when buggy.  They have
the best (IMHO) office suite of them all.  Their developement tools
are second to none (and even allow small businesses (and large ones)
access to those reported "secrets" available only to Microsoft).  I
use Microsoft products consistently, and every day.  I type my stories
in draft form in Microsoft Word (2000), relying on the IntelliSense
to help get my story in a good shape.  I use IE every time I'm on the
Internet.  The only times IE has ever crashed on me have been those lone
occaisions where I'm using too many resources, or running a stupid
Java app.  I use Microsoft Outlook to read my e-mail and keep track
off my To-Do list.  The point is, I don't need Netscape, and I'm not
going to try to force it to work when IE does everything I need
and more.</P>

<h2>I'm not Anti-Netscape, I'm Anti-AOL</h2>

<P>I don't use AOL's ownership as an excuse not to use Netscape, in
fact, when AOL bought Netscape I was hoping they would get rid of some
bugs and add more depth the Netscape like they did with <a href="http://www.icq.com">ICQ</a>.
Howver, its been over a year (hasn't it?) since Netscape 5 was
announced and nothing has been shown of any effort in releasing
version 5 at any time to the public.  Now, you could dismiss this
as Netscape trying to do things at their own pace, but I can't because
<b>this has happened before</b>.</P>

<P>Let me start the story at the beginning, way back in a time known
as 1993.  A time when a younger me was naive enough to trust the
company known as AOL.  I was using AOL 2.5 or so, and AOL was only
an adolescent, far from its short prime.  Steve Case announced a
buy-put of "a browser company".  At the time, the Internet was
virtually unknown, Yahoo was a lot smaller and younger, and not
as well known.  It was exciting to be able to see pages from far off
places (ie, outside of AOL).</P>

<P>What happened to that browser company?  The company, then number 2 or 4 or so
on the food chain, was competing in a world full of browsers, the
original Mosaic and its different flavors, plus a young Netscape.
The browser was distributed as a part of AOL only.  In time, everyone
began to despise and shiver in fear of the "AOL Browser".</P>

<P>Sure, some historical facts in that account may be clouded with
time, but the basics are true.  I hope that Netscape doesn't become
the next "AOL browser", but I think the truth may be that will happen,
or is already happening.  Especially now that AOL has bought/merged with
Time Warner...  but that is another editorial.</P>
