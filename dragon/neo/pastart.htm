<p>Past cover art from DRAGONzine too cool to let go:</p>

<img src="images/bigdragonlogofire.gif"><br>
<P>The DRAGONzine logo for a full incarnation, and still used in
banner ads and stuff...  too big to place in the magazine itself, I
still like it, and it may be recycled as often as possible.  The
dragon in the logo is from the unique ClipartCastle.Com, one of the
neatest royalty-free clipart sites out there.</P>

<img src="images/taralogo.jpg"><br>
<P>I love this logo too.  The logo graced DRAGONzine's news page for
Issue 7 and the (sorry) empty Issue 8.  Too big to fit on the new
incarnation's news page/frontpage, I would still love to recycle it
when I can.  The dragon can be found for adoption out to personal
web sites at Tara's nice <a href="http://alienship.tripod.com/">Alienship</a>
page.</P>
