If SOFTWARE PRODUCT is labeled "North America Only Version" on the SOFTWARE PRODUCT packaging or other written materials, then the following applies:  The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is intended for distribution only in the United States, its territories and possessions (including Puerto Rico, Guam, and U.S. Virgin Islands) and Canada. Export of  the SOFTWARE PRODUCT from the United States is regulated under "EI controls" of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR, 15 CFR 730-744) of the U.S. Commerce Department, Bureau of Export Administration (BXA).

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

THIS SOFTWARE AND THE ACCOMPANYING FILES ARE LICENSED TO YOU "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Should the Program prove defective, you and not Hagen Software assume the entire risk of using the program and the entire cost of any service and repair. Failure to install the program is not a valid reason for requesting a refund of the purchase price.  This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this agreement.

NO LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. 
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Hagen Software be liable for any damages whatsoever (including without limitation, special, incidental, consequential, or indirect damages for personal injury, loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use this product, even if Hagen Software has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In any case, Hagen Software's entire liability under any provision of this agreement shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you for the SOFTWARE.

NO WARRANTY FOR "YEAR 2000" OR "Y2K" COMPLIANCE:
To the best of our knowledge, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT will correctly recognize dates beyond December 31, 1999.  This assumes, however, that your operating system, your server's BIOS, your Perl installation, and any other hardware or software that may interact with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT are also Y2K compliant.  If they are not, then that will cause problems for this SOFTWARE PRODUCT as well, as it obtains time and date variables from the underlying operating system, which may also depend on a proper BIOS setting for your server and a proper installation of Perl.  Because there are so many other possible sources for non-compliance that we do not have any control over, Hagen Software specifically disclaims any warranty that the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is Y2K compliant.  We highly recommend that you make backups of all important data on or before December 31, 1999, just in case some other component of your system is not Y2K compliant.

REFUND POLICY

THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT AND THE ACCOMPANYING FILES ARE LICENSED TO YOU "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES AS TO PERFORMANCE OR MERCHANTABILITY OR ANY OTHER WARRANTIES WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.  BY PURCHASING OR USING THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THERE SHALL BE ABSOLUTELY NO REFUNDS FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING FAILURE TO INSTALL THE PROGRAM, A CHANGE IN MARKET CONDITIONS, A CHANGE IN BUSINESS OR WEB SITE STRATEGY, A CLAIM THAT THE PRODUCT DOES NOT SUIT YOUR NEEDS OR IS NOT WHAT YOU EXPECTED, MODIFICATIONS OF THE SOURCE CODE IMPLEMENTED BY THE USER THAT ALTER THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR THAT ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOCUMENTATION ACCOMPANYING THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT, THE UNAVAILABILITY OF HAGEN SOFTWARE FOR CUSTOMIZATIONS TO THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT, OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON.

BY PURCHASING OR USING THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE EXERCISED DUE DILIGENCE IN ASCERTAINING THAT THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT WILL RUN ON YOUR WEB SERVER AND THAT IT WILL MEET YOUR NEEDS.
