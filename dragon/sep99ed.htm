<P CLASS="news">Letter From The Editor</P>
<P>Okay, an issue has passed since I last wrote up what my goals were for the 'zine, and
a lot has happened...</P>

<P>On the new look-  I was actually playing around with a look for a
different site, but I liked it so much, and it was so similar to
DRAGON's current {at the time} layout that I ended up using it for
DRAGON, and it was released with Issue 4 (last issue).  All the
feedback so far has been positive and I'm glad of DRAGON's new look.</P>

<P>Now on to the real meat of this issue, this issue marks two new authors.  Plus, a sneak peak, as it were,
into my Fourth Azeroth-based Series, based on the Azerothian Crusades, named oddly enough, Azeroth: Crusade.  Olivia Cole, the youngest 
submitter to the 'zine, has submitted a multi-part "furry" adventure with her <a href="sep9902.htm">The Sun Fox</a>,
novellete.   Olivia's work is exceptional for such a young lady.  I hope to see more from her in the future.</P>

<P><a href="sep9901.htm">Murphy's Law</a> marks the Third Kayos story that I have written.  It continues on from where
<a href="jul9904.htm">DragonSphere</a> and <a href="aug9903.htm">Chaos Theory</a> left off.  Also in the Azeroth
Multiverse is <a href="sep9903.htm">Intro to War</a>, an Introduction to the Azerothian Crusades.  Now, I
felt like introducing people to the series before I was truly ready to start the series.  I have a great, incredible
idea that I have only discussed with a few friends, but would be just incredible, and I don't feel like ruining it for
you, so stay tuned for more info.</P>

<P>The Fourth Chapter of Mexican Penguin will not be seen in this issue,
or maybe even at all.  I am debating what to do with Mexican Penguin, and the
probably I am going to finish Chapter 4 (which is not by the way), and then
most likely I will go back through it and polish things a bit, rewrite some of
it...  Maybe get Laura to go through it and Edit it.  [I can edit others' work
a lot better than I can edit my own.]</P>

<P>Ernest Stewart has submitted three of his short stories from one of his upcoming books.
One (<a href="sep9904.htm">A Death Wish</a>) will be in this issue, and the other two
will be included in the next issue.</P>

<P>Homework is really pushing me...  I have so much to do and so little time!  The days seem
to fly by!  However I will continue to work on DRAGON as I can...  An interesting new developement
is the quickly growing DRAGONportal.  I have some great plans for DRAGONportal and I see it becoming
a customizable resource that will rival the biggest ones like MSN.com.</P>

<P>Well, thats it!  See you next time!  Don't forget that DRAGONrealm (click on "Realm" on the
Main Bar to your Left) has a great table of contents for finding the stories you want to read!</P>
