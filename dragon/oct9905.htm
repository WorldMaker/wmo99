<P CLASS="news">The Sun Fox: Part II by Olivia Cole</P>

<P>&#9;</B>And then one day, the Sun Fox came back.</P>

<P>&#9;Frexiin had long since passed away, for the first time I had seen the Sun Fox I was eight years old and Frex was ten. This time I was eleven and I saw the Sun Fox once again in the forest behind our home.</P>

<P>&#9;'Bye, mom! I'm taking Elf out for a run.'</P>

<P>&#9;I was already up and out the door, acting as if I hadn't heard my mother's warning.</P>

<P>&#9;'You know how fast that mare can go! Don't speed her up too much…'</P>

<P>&#9;But I was gone.</P>

<P>As I ran as if insane toward the stables, I planned out my day. We'd (the mare and I) take a long trail up to the Frog Zeniths, turn left at the crossroads and go into town to get her some water and let her rest while I talked to Jacob, the store owner, my mother's good friend. Jacob had given Elf to me on my sixth birthday. So I trusted him not as a grown up, but  a friend.</P>

<P>I stopped. Right in front of me was a beautiful vixen, the color of the reddish streak on a peach. The fiery tone of the sun. The shade of a maple's syrup. The hue of a… My mind stopped and blurred back to the day I first saw this creature; the Sun Fox, the Goddess of the Sun. When I was eight.</P>

<P>She turned and floated up a steep hill and stopped at the top. So long ago I had only imagined what she said. But now, I heard her words inside my intellect.</P>

<P>'Come, follow me, leave your problems behind, Get your horse and follow me, Lily.'</P>

<P>I now noticed that I was right next to the stable. I had been so enchanted to hear her voice, I hadn't realized where I was. </P>

<P>Racing inside, I trotted Elf out of her stall, saddled her, checked the girth, pulled on the bit and bridle, and climbed on. Clicking to her, I urged Elf to go as fast as she was able. And, boy, she did!</P>

<P>I hadn't allowed her to &quot;stretch her legs&quot; for a while, so she broke out in a full blood hurdle for the hills as soon as I slacked off on the reins. I only directed her a bit, making sure she was on the right course toward the Sun Fox, who still stood on top of the hill. As soon as we got close enough, the vixen raised her head and stepped lightly, almost on air, away, zigzagging around trees, and leading us at her will.</P>

<P>Elf indeed was a very fast mare. It was all I could do to hold on and keep my eyes on the vixen. I think Elf too knew there was something strange in the Sun Fox, so she flew along for an hour after our charge at the same mind boggling pace.</P>

<P>The Sun Fox was indeed the quickest most intelligent animal I had ever witnessed. She paced herself in running, admirably dashing on for miles without ever breathing harder than normal. </P>

<P>She amazed me with her agility, jumping over logs lying in her path that were more than four feet high. Elf easily sprang over these barriers, landing a few feet in front of the hurdle, gaining some ground to the Sun Fox. I could tell our struggles to catch her up amused the vixen, (she smiled ever so smugly) for I could plainly see that we would never catch her. But, as I said when I was eight, she was enchanted, and I was chosen to ensue. I was her servant, her minion, and I was bound by the bonds of trust and loyalty to follow her where ever she happened to go.</P>

<P>I soon found myself plowing up a steep hill, almost like a mountain. I looked around and soon realized that we were on the Frog Zeniths, and the going was tough, but Elf was entitled strength from the Sun Fox. It wafted from her like a summer breeze from the north. I felt spiritedness flood through my muscles and veins, and I could feel the strength flow through Elf's body beneath me like water in a stream.</P>

<P>I wager you're wondering, 'Why doesn't Lily just stop following the vixen? It would save herself a lot of difficulty.' Well, I couldn't. Have you ever seen something so beautiful, you don't want to turn away? Something so enchanting that you never want to go back to your world? You want to stay with this enchantment forever until your lungs may no longer breathe, until your heart may not longer beat, your tongue may no longer speak, and your eyes may no longer sleep? If you saw the Sun Fox as I did, you would know. You would follow her until your heart erupted. She was a goddess that made you realize what true passion meant. A goddess that showed you that if you follow your heart, you will find your wish. And my wish was to catch up to the Sun Fox, and before long, I would.</P>

<P>That day was the best day that I ever had. That was the day when I met the Sun Fox, face to face, speaking together as two friends which had seen many years simultaneously.  </P>

<P>Elf was tiring slowly, and the vixen we so loyally followed slowed to a trot so we were but five feet behind her, but could not come closer. She called back into my head,</P>

<P>'Your mare is faithful as you once were and are now. I will let you catch up with me, true servant. No lone soul has ever seen my world. But you, my menial friend, are the exception. I will show you why I have come to you. You will see my world and the destruction that panthers bring to it. I am the Queen of  Light, the Sun Fox, the Vixen of All Realms, the Empress of Smoke, the Majesty of Fire. And you are my Cardinal Minion, Lily, my Head Servant. The Dark will obliterate our World if the Panther Wardens win. My bucks and birds will not be able to hold the wards off for long. If you allow me to enchant you and your horse, you will have powers of mine. You will be able to travel as swift as the myna, be as valiant as wolves, and slick as smoke. Your cleverness will be as sharp as the tongue of an adder, and you will be my minion as you are now, my friend.'</P>

<P>I nodded and spoke with anew certainty,</P>

<P>'Yes, O Queen of Light, O Vixen of Realms, O Sun Fox!'</P>

<P>The vixen smiled and nodded approvingly as she led on.</P>
