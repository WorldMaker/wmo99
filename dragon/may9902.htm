<CENTER>
<P>"Do not worry, O ye people,"<BR>
Cried St. George, valian and brave,<BR>
"I shall rid ye of the dragon,<BR>
"And the city, I shall save."</P>

<P>The crowd went wild as George rode off,<BR>
Rode off towards the Dragon's Lair.<BR>
He rode up to the mouth of the cave,<BR>
Reined his horse, and hesitated there.</P>

<P>"Now if I slay this mighty beast,"<BR>
St. George thought aloud,<BR>
"I'll save the city, have treasure,too;<BR>
"I'll be a hero, famous and proud."</P>

<P>Now, it was known across the land,<BR>
By every serf, and every lord,<BR>
The dragon fought so mightily well,<BR>
Because she guarded a treasure hoard.</P>

<P>Knight after knight rode to the Lair of the Dragon,<BR>
Drew their swords, said a prayer, and walked right in.<BR>
They fought and fought in that horrid dark cave,
And, as far as I know, didn't come out again.</P>

<P>Finally, St. George dismounted,<BR>
And told himself that he was better than the rest.<BR>
He drew his sword and entered the cave,<BR>
Hoping, praying that he could be the best.</P>

<P>The dragon heard his footsteps fall,<BR>
And she shivered greatly with fear.<BR>
"Please don't come in," she thought.<BR>
"Please, please, don't come in here."</P>

<P>"I never did a thing to you,<BR>
"Please just let me be, Sir Knight.<BR>
"I am wounded and I am weak,<BR>
"And I do not think that I can fight."</P>

<P>But then she thought of the treasure she guarded,<BR>
And there was a spark of fire in her eye.<BR>
She thought of the treasure, and she knew,<BR>
She would not, whe <i>could not</i> let herself die.</P>

<P>"Prepare to die, foul beast!" Cried St. George,<BR>
As the dragon rose to a terrifying height.<BR>
They put teeth to armor, iron to scales,<BR>
And fought a long and bloody fight.</P>

<P>In the end, George's sword struck home.<BR>
With a blood-curling scream, Dragon fell to the ground.<BR>
George retrieved his sword, pushed the carcass away,<BR>
And what do you think he found?</P>

<P>The very treasure so many craved;<BR>
The treasure the dragon just had to keep;<BR>
The treasure he just fought so hard for:<BR>
<b>A baby dragon, fast asleep.</b></P>

<P>He put the cold steel to the baby's neck,<BR>
And prepared to do as he promised the town:<BR>
Rid them of dragons, now and forever.<BR>
But, he just couldn't bring the sword down.</P>

<P>Instead, he picked the creature up,<BR>
And as he carried it out, it never once stirred.<BR>
He put it in his horse's saddlebag,<BR>
Mounted and rode off, all without saying a word.</P>

<P>He set the baby dragon free,<BR>
But claimed that the last of the dragons, he had slayed.<BR>
Not knowing his secret, the town called him a hero.<BR>
The people gave him medals, and even a parade.</P>

<P>The last of the dragons still lives on,<BR>
Near the city in a cave.<BR>
And there he'll live forever more,<BR>
Thanks to St. George, the valiant and brave.<BR>
