<P CLASS="news">The Sun Fox: Part III</P>
<FONT FACE="Georgia Ref,Georgia" SIZE=3><P>The next time the Sun Fox stopped we caught up and were standing next to her. I looked down on her from my mount, awaiting an order.</P>

<P>'Dismount, please.' she said.</P>

<P>I nodded my head and dismounted gracefully. When I stood next to her, she spoke again.</P>

<P>&quot;Are you undoubted that you will allow me to enchant your charger and yourself?&quot;</P>

<P>'Yes, O Vixen of Realms,' I uttered respectfully, 'whatever pleases and assists you.' </P>

<P>The Queen of Light nodded and reared up on her back legs only. Balancing lightly, she put a slender paw on my leg and her other on Elf's. The mare didn't move, we both stood stock still. Staring at the earth, the Vixen of Realms murmured a few strange words I didn't understand and I felt a strange sharpness in my back and Elf whinnied distinctly and as I raised my head, the white horse grew two enormous wings that belonged to a Pegasus on her back, and two snow ivory stag's antlers extended from the sides of her head. She was a Pegasus with a buck's antlers!</P>

<P>Something shimmering and silver caught my eye behind my back and how surprised I was to turn to find two long silvered fairy's wings sprouting from my shoulder blades. The Sun Fox nodded approvingly.</P>

<P>'There,' she said in her flowing voice, 'now both of us can fly your Pegastag (a Pegasus and stag mixed) into my castle; The City of the Sun: Malkarizz.'</P>

<P>Still thinking of the strange name for her world, I lifted her onto Elf's back, feeling her silky fur and light weight, then, climbing on behind her, the Sun Fox whispered a few strange words in my mare's ear and the &quot;Pegastag&quot; glided into the air as if she had been flying all her life. We made toward the bright sun and then veered left. </P>

<P>'Get some sleep,' the Queen of Light said 'it's a long journey.'</P>

<P>I did for a while, going to sleep thinking about my beautiful wings, and when I awoke, I was in a soft downy hammock. There were eagle feathers stitched to every inch of the hanging bed, so it was like being on an eagle. The cushion I laid my untroubled head on was made of the softest fuzz from an owlet. Then I heard bustling actions in the chamber where I slept, and sitting up with eyes wide open, I saw the strangest sight I had ever beheld.</P>

<P>It was a sparrow! But what was so strange was she had dragonfly wings! Reaching behind me, I gently grasped my right wing and pulled it delicately into my vision. </P>

<P>I tried not to swell with happiness. What a pretty thing it was! Silvery and delicate, but not that of an insect's wing. As if reading my contemplation, the fairy across the room spoke in a strange tongue, but even stranger, I understood!</P>

<P>'Hello there! Your wings are that of the cardinal's, you know, the redbird. Lucky thing, you are. The Queen of Light must have taken a liking to you. She gives everyone else insect wings.'</P>

<P>Adjusting my eyes to the dim light in the large chamber, I undiluted her wings, noticing this time the ailerons growing from her back were not feathered, just insect's.</P>

<P>'The Vixen of Realms said I am her Cardinal Minion,' I said, speaking the strange tongue as well, 'I suppose that is why she gave me this pair of wings…'</P>

<P>Immediately the sparrow went down on her knees, bowing her head.</P>

<P>'The Empress of Smoke said we were to have a new Cardinal, but I knew not it 'twas you!' </P>

<P>'Are you a minion as well?' I asked.</P>

<P>The fairy bowed her head lower, stammering,</P>

<P>'Yes, Cardinal, I am, and I serve you!' </P>

<P>I lowered my eyebrows and thought for a moment, thinking of what to say to my charge. I would most like to see the Sun Fox and speak with her about this, so I said,</P>

<P>'What is your name? Tell me and take me to the Queen of Light. I would wish to speak with her.'</P>

<P>'My name is Sparrow, Chief, come, I will take you to the Sun Fox.'</P>

<P>I followed the minion down enormous corridors and gaped at them until Sparrow stopped in front of two tremendous doors, carved beautifully of a solid wood, images showing vixens of generations of the past leading small birds, birds of prey, and bucks, flooding toward panthers with angry mouths wide open with curving fangs stretching.</P>

<P>Sparrow stopped and turned to me, bowing low.</P>

<P>'I may go no farther, Cardinal,' then, adding with a smile, 'Maybe the Empress of Smoke will give you a title, a Malkarizz title; like Osprey Cardinal, or Chief Osprey, maybe even a falcon title if she favors you.' And she was gone.</P>

<P>Knocking on the massive doors, I said respectfully, </P>

<P>'O Empress of Smoke, I come with questions!' </P>

<P>The doors swung inward almost immediately, revealing the Queen of Light sitting on a throne appliqu&eacute; a wide window that displayed the beautiful countryside of Malkarizz.</P>

<P>'Good morning, my Cardinal Minion, how did you sleep?' </P>

<P>'Just fine, O Empress of Smoke, I have come with questions, as I said before.'</P>

<P>She turned and smiled, delighted at giving me more knowledge.</P>

<P>'Ask away, faithful servant.'</P>

<P>I began asking my questions, the Sun Fox answering every one in perfect understanding. It turns out, I was able to speak the tongue of her kingdom because she gave me the powers to do so. I was right, I had been given the wings of a cardinal because I was the Cardinal Minion. I asked my final question then.</P>

<P>'O Queen of Light, I ask that you give me a name, for I wish to fit in, and Cardinal Lily doesn't seem just right…&quot;</P>

<P>The Queen's ears perked up and she leaned forward with excitement.</P>

<P>'Oh, good! I see you have been informed of this by Sparrow, the bird you met earlier. I enjoy greatly naming creatures of my realm. Let's see… Hmmm…'</P>

<P>She rose from her dais and paced around me on all four legs, as usual, and studied me, thinking of a name that would suit me. Suddenly her eyes brightened with interest.</P>

<P>'Good minion, would you mind if I changed you to your name?'</P>

<P>I was puzzled.</P>

<P>'What do you mean, O Vixen of Realms?'</P>

<P>She thought a moment and studied me some more before answering.</P>

<P>'Whatever your name is, such as Kestrel or Sparrowhawk, or Gyrfalcon, would you mind at all of being turned into what your name is?'</P>

<P>'You mean,' I said, 'if my name was Kestrel, I would be a kestrel?'</P>

<P>She beamed with delight.</P>

<P>'Exactly!'</P>

<P>My eyes widened at this new thrilling change of shape.</P>

<P>'I would not mind at all, Majesty of Fire, I would be pleasured!' </P>

<P>She grinned like a young one in anticipation of using her capabilities. Again she paced about me and looked me up and down with a critical eye, muttering,</P>

<P>'Must be fast and strong, powerful wings, hooked beak, beautiful, large, and savage…' </P>

<P>Bringing her front paws up above her head, she declared,</P>

<P>'You're name will be… Gyrfalcon!'</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE=3><P>As she spoke, a dazzling, brilliant flash of magical light burst from her paws, and when the haze cleared, I found myself screeching and fluttering a magnificent pair of ivory white wings and my whole white body, whipping powerful gusts of air about. I was the same size, shape, beauty, and savageness as a gyrfalcon. I <I>was</I> one.</P></FONT>
