			<TD VALIGN=TOP>About the Triple Review:</TD>
			<TD>Not normally are three books reviewed at the same time, but I felt an exception was to be made for the
		three books that have really made an impact from young children to adults.</TD>
		</TR><TR>
			<TD VALIGN=TOP>Synopsis:</TD>
			<TD>Harry Potter takes on the forces of evil and the mages of dark magic in a unique series that give <A HREF="http://www.bmvs.com/sites/dragonbooks/books/qsearch.asp?by=author&keywords=Roald+Dahl&startat=0">Roald
		Dahl</A>'s classic <A HREF="http://www.bmvs.com/sites/dragonbooks/books/view.asp?id=3135730&ref=1">Matilda</A> a run for its money.  There is something about the humor and 
		imagination of the British that draws us poor Americans [:) joke] to their wild stories.</TD>
		</TR><TR>
			<TD VALIGN=TOP>General:</TD>
			<TD><P>One of the first children's writer to grab three New York Times Bestseller spots, J. K. Rowling has grabbed the attention
		of millions of readers.  Harry Potter's American visage (drawn by a great illustrator from, if memory serves me right, Ohio) has graced
		the cover of Time Magazine.  One wonder's how many other children's characters have graced those covers.  The fun part is the books are
		worth the read, even if you are a stubborn muggle adult [:) joke].</P></TD>
		</TR><TR>
			<TD VALIGN=TOP>Magic:</TD>
			<TD><P>J. K. Rowling uses the commonly accepted form of magic that is found in many other stories so that
		she can get on with the story.  This in no way impairs her use of magic.  In fact, she makes fun of a few stereotypes,
		and draws some humor in her magical incantations, such as 'Ridikkulus!'.  Many of her incantations and other names
		are latin-sounding, but usually give clues to what they do.</P></TD>
		</TR><TR>
			<TD VALIGN=TOP>Franchise:</TD>
			<TD><P>WARNING!  THIS SECTION MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!</P>
		<P>Harry Potter is a <b>huge</b> marketing tool.  These are only the first three books of a series of at least 7 books (one for every year at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry).
		It is said that J. K. Rowling has already sold movie rights (which is rather early...  Hollywood must be really impressed with her books).  My opinions on the continuation of the series:
		1) Harry <b>has</b> to tell Fred and George who wrote the Maurader's Map in Book 4.  No Ifs, Ands, or Buts about it.  [:)]  2) <i>Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic</i> would make a great
		TV show name. [:)]  3) Last thing, I think that J. K. Rowling should mention other countries...  For instance, does America have a Department of Magic (and thus a Secretary of Magic who is
		on the President's cabinet), and are there any good Wizarding schools in the US?  [PS...  I wouldn't mind being a sizth year (or so) in a movie...  I've got glasses, and the unruly hair for it.  :)]</P></TD>
		</TR><TR>
			<TD VALIGN=TOP>Guidance:</TD>
			<TD><P>There is a small usage of curse words, most especially in the third book, that some American readers may find
		offensive.</P></TD>
		</TR><TR>
			<TD VALIGN=TOP>Conclusion:</TD>
			<TD><P>Harry Potter is a law unto himself, as are his stories.  Beware of biting books and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named as you
		read through these delightful romps.  [:)]</P></TD>
